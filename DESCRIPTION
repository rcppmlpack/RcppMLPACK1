Author: Qiang Kou, Ryan Curtin
Maintainer: Qiang Kou <qkou@umail.iu.edu>
Description:  MLPACK is an intuitive, fast, scalable C++ machine learning
   library, meant to be a machine learning analog to LAPACK. It
   aims to implement a wide array of machine learning methods
   and function as a Swiss army knife for machine learning
   researchers: MLPACK is from http://www.mlpack.org/: sources are included in the package.
SystemRequirements: A C++11 compiler. Version 4.6.* of g++ (as currently in                         
 Rtools) is insufficient; versions 4.8.*, 4.9.* or later will be fine.
